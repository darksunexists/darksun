# Dark Sun ðŸŒ‘

Originally, the `eliza` directory was in its own repository and used as a submodule. For purposes of releasing the codebase, we've moved it into this repository so everything is in one place.

## Setup

Nearly identical setup to Eliza. But for ease, to have it built, run the following:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

Custom Packages:

- [client-investigate](./eliza/packages/client-investigate)

- [client-backroom](./eliza/packages/client-backroom)

- [plugin-investigate](./eliza/packages/plugin-investigate)

- [plugin-research](./eliza/packages/plugin-research)

- [service-trigger](./eliza/packages/service-trigger)

- [client-twitter-v2](./eliza/packages/client-twitter-v2)

- [adapter-postgres](./eliza/packages/adapter-postgres)

## Note

This codebase is now archived, and is no longer maintained. As it is under the MIT license, you are free to use the code as you wish.
